new “classes” of bugs: 
- data consistency
- scalability
- topology

killer bugs:
- cascading failure
- no single point of failure
- Time-of-Faults (TOF) bugs


software bugs: 
- logic-specific
- error handling
- optimization
- configuration
- data race
- hang
- space
- load

cloud systems favour availability (reliability & data consistency) over “correctness”

Nodes are important -> Relationship between nodes
Asynchronous calls can lead to failure of nodes
Error handling researched in many papers 


metrics:
- LOC (lines of code)
- NOC (number of children)
- Calls between classes/microservices
- Affected nodes after crash
- number of method calls -> complexity
- weighted methods per class
